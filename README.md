**DataSet**

We have to analyze the flight fare prediction using Machine Learning dataset using essential exploratory data analysis techniques then will draw some predictions about the price of the flight based on some features such as what type of airline it is, what is the arrival time, what is the departure time, what is the duration of the flight, source, destination and more.

Problem Statement:
Flight ticket prices can be something hard to guess, today we might see a price, check out the price of the same flight tomorrow, it will be a different story. We might have often heard travelers saying that flight ticket prices are so unpredictable. Thatâ€™s why we will try to use machine learning to solve this problem. This can help airlines by predicting what prices they can maintain. 

Task 1:-Prepare a complete data analysis report on the given data.

Task 2:-Create a predictive model which will help the customers to predict future flight prices and plan their journey accordingly.

**Conclusion:**
The predictive model, particularly the Random Forest algorithm, demonstrated promising results with an R2 score of 81%. This model can be further fine-tuned and deployed for predicting flight prices, benefiting both airlines and customers in making informed decisions. The EDA insights provide valuable information on factors influencing flight prices, aiding in strategic decision-making.
